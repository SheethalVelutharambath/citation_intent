 to provide great  exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses huelsenbeck  rannala  and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships kuhner  felsenstein  huelsenbeck  constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design a number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously there is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions but almost no published quantitative results it is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times will exhibit too few di erences to contain useful evolutionary information equally sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change high rates or long times become saturated with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise consequently a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence but the  symptotic results for extreme high and low levels of divergence give no clue as to where this lies although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms see hillis   pp  for an extensive list of studies where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchersa priori expectations in addition a large laboratory e ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached the methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e ects of varying levels of divergence they con rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence the necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected the only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of yang  this uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree topology inference the approach may be extremely time consuming for realistic problems the choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed li   considered the e ects of adding outgroup taxa and ritland  clegg  and maddison

multiple equilibria see albanesi   king and wolman  and blake and kirsanova  and a simple new keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation as there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter the central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this how do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models if multiplicity survives how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium to address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation sveen and weinke  woodford  this model contains all the features as at the heart of many dsge models used in policy analysis which makes it a  representative agent  for our policy analysis moreover we choose a set up which encompasses the  worst case  scenario there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium dennis and kirsanova  we confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium at the same time we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps moreover new equilibria arise under delegation whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions more encouragingly all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the pareto preferred equilibrium we also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium in particular we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes the paper is organized as follows in the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration section  recapitulates the analysis in blake and kirsanova  for our sticky price model with capital showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective

 to provide great  exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses huelsenbeck  rannala  and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships kuhner  felsenstein  huelsenbeck  constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design a number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously there is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions but almost no published quantitative results it is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times will exhibit too few di erences to contain useful evolutionary information equally sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change high rates or long times become saturated with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise consequently a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence but the  symptotic results for extreme high and low levels of divergence give no clue as to where this lies although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms see hillis   pp  for an extensive list of studies where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchersa priori expectations in addition a large laboratory e ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached the methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e ects of varying levels of divergence they con rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence the necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected the only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of yang  this uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree topology inference the approach may be extremely time consuming for realistic problems the choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed li   considered the e ects of adding outgroup taxa and ritland  clegg  and maddison   are agreed that if outgroups are to be added they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa a conclusion that is con rmed in this paper more recently consideration of the estimation of large phylogenies has led to the contradictory advice that the number of sequences included in a study be reduced kim  and increased particularly to break long branches in trees hillis  in order to improve inferences see also hillis  although it is not clear that the latter strategy will always be successful zharkikh  li  kim  strimmer  von haeseler  and hillis  have

 to provide great  exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses huelsenbeck  rannala  and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships kuhner  felsenstein  huelsenbeck  constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design a number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously there is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions but almost no published quantitative results it is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times will exhibit too few di erences to contain useful evolutionary information equally sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change high rates or long times become saturated with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise consequently a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence but the  symptotic results for extreme high and low levels of divergence give no clue as to where this lies although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms see hillis   pp  for an extensive list of studies where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchersa priori expectations in addition a large laboratory e ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached the methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e ects of varying levels of divergence they con rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence the necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected the only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of yang  this uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree topology inference the approach may be extremely time consuming for realistic problems the choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed li   considered the e ects of adding outgroup taxa and ritland  clegg  and maddison   are agreed that if outgroups are to be added they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa a conclusion that is con rmed in this paper
